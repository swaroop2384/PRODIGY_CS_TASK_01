# PRODIGY_CS_TASK_01
Accomplished the 1st task of my Cyber Security Internship at Prodigy InfoTech! Built a Python program to encrypt & decrypt messages using Caesar Cipher. The program prompts for operation (encrypt/decrypt), message, and key (shift number).This method uses a simple substitution where letters shift by a set number for encryption/decryption.
